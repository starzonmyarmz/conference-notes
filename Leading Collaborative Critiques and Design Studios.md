Leading Collaborative Critiques and Design Studios
==================================================
Adam Connor and Aaron Irizarry @ UI17 Conference, Boston, MA

- What problem(s) is the design trying to solve?
- Ask "Why am I asking for critique?" or "Why am I offering critique?"

- Selfish critique is unhelpful feedback. Critique should not be selfish. "I don't like this" or "I don't like that". It carries negative intent.
- Selfless critique is all about helping the designer(s). It has nothing to do with self recognition. It should be solving "What do we have to do to get the design to where it needs to be?" 

- The best critique is always a discussion. Asking questions and clarifying.

### Tips for giving critique

- Use a filter. Gather initial thoughts and reactions. Revisit them in the right context.
- Don't assume. Find out the reason behind thinking, constraints or other variables.
- Don't invite yourself. Get in touch and ask to chat about the design. You don't know if the designer is ready for feedback.
- Lead with questions. Show interest in their process. It will help dial back the designers defense.
- Talk about strengths. Critique isn't just about things that aren't working.


- Receiving critique with the right intent takes humility and a bit of restraint. Remove yourself from the product. Listen to what the feedback is. Are you really looking for critique or high fives?

### Tips for receiving critique

- Remember the purpose. Critique is about understanding and improvement, not judgement.
- Listen and think before you talk back. Do you understand what the critics are saying. Factoid: the brain works 4 times faster than your mouth.
- Participate. Analyze your proposed solution with everyone else. It allows you to step back from your designer roll, and let everyone else feel like you're one of them.
- Set the right foundation. Use knowledge and prior agreements to get everyone on the same page. You need to know the focus of the project is in order to critique.

### Tools for setting context

- Scenarios
- Personas
- Goals
- Principles

### Making critique part of your process

#### Standalone Critiques (and why their awesome)

- Intoduction to people unfamiliar with critique.
- Safer place to practice giving and receiving feedback
- Focus feedback on specific goals/topics/etc.
- Two approaches: impromptu (example of a running chat) and scheduled.

#### Design Reviews (and their challenges)

- It is not (supposed to be) a critique!
- Used to get approval or some kind of "blessing"
- Timing determined by project timeline
- Often too large of an audience and many have the wrong intent
- Output, if not approval, is typically a list of specified changes

##### Making the most of a Design Review

- Take control as much as possible
- Recap the goals and principles of the design
- Use the same tools as you would for dealing with difficult people. Note: not all difficult people are bad people
- Don't rely on them for critique. Be prepared to schedule a more focused session.

#### Brainstorms and Collaborative Meetings (and the problem with them)

- The problem with brainstorms is there is usually no agenda, and is going to be a major waste of time.
- Progress too quickly into group think mentality. Mutations of the same idea.
- You fail to generate more ideas than would be produced by a single contributor
- Are used for, but not meant for, achieving consensus.

### Things to keep in mind

- Critique is a skill. It only gets better with practice.
- Start small.
- Think before you speak.
- Choose who you critique with carefully. You don't want people that aren't interested or over-dominating involved.
- As long as you have time to iterate, it's always a good time to critique
- Send out materials (designs) ahead of time so you don't get gut reactions. It gives the reviewers time to process the material.
- Present quickly. Don't get overly nerdy. Not everyone knows or cares about the unnecessary details. The context builds throughout the critique.

### Rules of critique

- Avoid problem solving and design decisions. The goal is to analyze the design - not brainstorm or fix problems that don't exist yet. When someone starts offering suggestions, kindly ask to follow up with that person later in order to keep the critique on track.
- The designer is responsible for follow up and decisions. Just because someone is higher up than you doesn't mean they know more about design than you.
- Everyone is equal.
- Everyone is a critic. Silent people are often ticking time bombs. Get feedback out of everyone!
- Mutually understood and agreed upon goals are critical
- Critique can be done internally or with clients. Use up to 6 people for about 1 hour. People get tired and lose focus.

### Facilitating critique

- Critique goals
- Active listening, question for clarity.
- Round robin. Keep things moving along.
- Direct inquiry. Good to get input from an expert in the group or from getting someone who's really quiet to talk.
- Quotas (good for round robin method). Find one thing that works well, and ask two questions for clarification/feedback.
- Six thinking hats (google it)
- Facilitators - if you're unfamiliar with critiquing, have someone else critique

### Dealing with difficult people

- You will deal with difficult people. Be prepared.
- Set expectations at the beginning of the session. Recap what you're objective of the session is.
- Make sure everyone understands critique. We're not looking for personal opinions.
- Ask quiet people for feedback directly
- Refer back to personas, goals and principles
- Use laddering (The 5 Whys). Keep asking why and look for clarification.
- Critique with people individually. If someone doesn't do well in a group setting, meet with them one on one. They don't feel like they need to impress anyone because it's just the two of you. It helps build relationships. Try to do it before a critique session.

### What comes next?

- Take notes on how people participate. Will help you tailor how to run a critique and who to involve.
- Follow up with individuals based on feedback/insight they've given you.
- Thank people for participating. Let them know what you'll be working on next. Keep communication going!
