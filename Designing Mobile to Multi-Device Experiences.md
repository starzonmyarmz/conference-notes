- It's too easy to misclassify devices in device-specific terms. Classify devices in human ergonomic terms: Palm, Lap, & Desk because it is more future proof. Could also classify by IO interaction: Touch/Gestures or Cursor/Keyboard.
-- Some devices are blurring lines like the laptops that flip over and become a tablet. Sony (and others) have touchscreen "desktops" (20-inch device).
-- New device "Leap" (only $60) you put in front of any device, and it lets you interact with the device using touch gestures.
-- Some phones have keyboards and trackballs.
-- High-dpi screens

- Any device is potentially a touch/gesture or cursor/keyboard device. This is good news. We won't have to design for broken device segments anymore.

### Multi-Device Design
-- Work Mobile First
-- Support a Continuum of Screens
-- Account for Hi Res
-- Optimize for Touch
-- Support Cursor & Keyboard

- User-first is obvious, you should be doing that anyway before you build the productâ€¦ just like if you're building a car or anything else.
